      The  *Search* tool allows you to search across Narratives, Reference, and Example data. Your search will reach into all Workspaces to which you have access, including **you own**, those **shared with you**, and those which are **shared with all users (public)**.

      # Markdown Test

      This section is here to exercise all Markdown styling to ensure that our styles work well.

      ## Paragraphs

      This is a paragraph. It is long enough, I believe, to ensure that wrapping occurs. Let's make sure that wrapping is a good readable line length.

      Markdown does let you
      break lines however
      you
      like
      and keep them as a whole paragraph.

      You can also override this with two  
      or more spaces  
      at the end of a line.

      ## Font Styles

      Now we turn to the font styles. The basic ones are *emphasis* (usually *italics*) and **strong** (aka **bold**). 
      
      The less common ~~strikethrough~~. 
      
      They can all be combined? *__italic bold__*, **_bold italic**, **~~bold strikethrough~~**, ad nauseum.

      ## Header Styles

      

      ## Links

      Links are not encouraged in help text, rather please use the "references" section in the help config file.

      We may come up with a more sophisticated method of linking (e.g. to provide links within the ui) but not yet.

      ## Embedding Images

      Images should not be embedded directly into a document, but used as references. Images are stored in locally in the plugin
      in the resources/images directory. You should use the special prefix $IMAGES/ with your images. The help viewer will translate 
      these into the correct format for loading images in the ui.

      > implement this!
